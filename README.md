# Simple Blackjack Game 🎲🃏

A minimal blackjack game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
The game logic is straightforward:  

- The user is dealt **two random cards** at the start.  
- If the total is **above 21**, the user loses immediately and can start a new game.  
- If the total is **below 21**, the user can **draw a new card**.  
- If the user reaches **exactly 21**, they win.
- If the user goes **above 21** after drawing, they lose and can start a new game.  

It’s that simple!
